\begin{abstract}

This paper addresses the issues of aerial manipulation concerning dynamic center of mass variations by deriving a control principle capable of exploiting disturbance as a means to stabilize the UAV. A complete mathematical model of an aerial robot consisting of rotorcraft UAV body and a generic multiple degree of freedom manipulator is provided. A coupled control scheme utilizing both rotor speed control and mass distribution using the mid-ranging approach is disseminated. We present the extensive simulation result using an example use case aerial robot. Finally, we present the experimental results for an aerial robot consisting of two moving masses distributed in a standard plus configuration in order to compare our proposed control paradigm with standard multirotor attitude control.
