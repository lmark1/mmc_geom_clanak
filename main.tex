\begin{abstract}

This paper is focused on presenting the concept of geometric tracking control for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on variations in center of gravity. It has the ability to exploit its dynamic center of mass as a means of stabilization and control. A mathematical model of such system will be given as grounds for developing the nonlinear geometric tracking controller on the special Euclidean group SE(3). It will be shown that the chosen control terms have desirable properties. Finally, two sets of Gazebo simulation results for a selected trajectory tracking problem using two unique UAV concepts will be presented.
