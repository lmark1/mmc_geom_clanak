\section{Conclusion}
ISPRAVITI!!!!!!!!!In this paper we proposed MMC-VPC attitude control for UAVs. The approach utilizes both shifting of the vehicle's CoG and variations of rotors' angular velocity. In simulation environment we successfully tested the proposed control strategy for quadcopter equipped with dual arm manipulator. We have shown that manipulator operates on higher bandwidth, changing the vehicle's CoG, thus enabling fast change of attitude. At the same time rotors operate on lower bandwidth, making sure the moving masses avoid saturation limits, which is one key benefit of this control strategy. In experimental setup, we tested the control approach on $\mu$MORUS UAV during several successful flights, and showed the results which are comparable to the standard rotor based attitude control. Furthemore, the results comply with the presented mathematical model and simulation results.
