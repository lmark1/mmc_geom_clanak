\section{Conclusion}

Geometric control was presented and implemented for two separate UAV models with variable centers of gravity. Although the controller has been constructed without actuator dynamics in mind, during the simulations its effect can be seen. Manipulator actuator dynamics have a considerable impact throughout the whole trajectory tracking problem. Due to their simplicity, moving mass actuator dynamics have a noticeably faster transient effect, which in turn means better performance in trajectory tracking. 

The overall effect of control terms \ref{force_control} and \ref{moment_control} which include $\textbf{r}_{CoG}$ becomes negligible if considering slower trajectories. In such cases, both UAVs can be observed as having CoG inside the origin of the body-fixed frame yielding simpler control terms.
\todo{Osim ovog gore komentara da je sve lose nema nikakve kvalitativne ni kvantitativne analize rezultata, osim slika. Trebalo bi opisati malo detaljnije sto se vidi i sto se ocekivalo a sto se dobilo. I naravno. nije sve tako lose kao sto si gore napisao}
