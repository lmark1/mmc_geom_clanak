\section{Conclusion}

Geometric control was presented and implemented for two separate UAV models with variable centers of gravity. Although the controller has been constructed without actuator dynamics in mind, during the simulations its effect can be seen. Trajectory problem given to the manipulator controlled UAV had to be somewhat slower in order to be successfully completed. Even still, worse performance can be observed in manipulator controlled UAV \ref{fig:manip_pos} compared to the moving mass UAV \todo{Jako losa recenica worse performance}
The main reason for such behavior is the considerably slower actuator dynamics for mounted manipulators. As a result the carried payload will produce much\todo{Izbjegavaj much} slower change in center of gravity than moving masses. \\
The overall effect of control terms \ref{force_control} and \ref{moment_control} which include $\textbf{r}_{CoG}$ becomes negligible if considering slower trajectories. In such cases, both UAVs can be observed as having CoG inside the origin of the body-fixed frame yielding simpler control terms.
\todo{Osim ovog gore komentara da je sve lose nema nikakve kvalitativne ni kvantitativne analize rezultata, osim slika. Trebalo bi opisati malo detaljnije sto se vidi i sto se ocekivalo a sto se dobilo. I naravno. nije sve tako lose kao sto si gore napisao}
