\section{Conclusion}
Geometric control was presented and implemented for two separate UAV models with variable centers of gravity. Although the controller has been constructed without actuator dynamics in mind, during the simulations its effect can be seen. \\
Moving mass actuator dynamics have a noticeably faster transient effect than the manipulator dynamics. This claim can be affirmed by observing \ref{fig:cog_error} where variations in CoG produced by MMC occur quicker and achieve greater magnitudes than those produced by the carried payload. Therefore, it is expected that the UAV with MMC achieves better position and attitude tracking than UAV carrying a payload. In \ref{fig:traj_pos} it can be seen that this expectation is validated. In the first case(MMC) excellent tracking performance can be observed, while in the second case(payload) measured position along the y-axis exhibits tracking delay and lower magnitude with respect to the desired position. \\
The overall effect of control terms \ref{force_control} and \ref{moment_control} which include $\textbf{r}_{CoG}$ becomes negligible if considering slower trajectories. In such cases, both UAVs can be observed as having CoG inside the origin of the body-fixed frame yielding simpler control terms.
